Reflective Journal - 1

================================================================================

In this first reflective journal, I want to summarise my experience in the ADS1001 unit. Last semester, I was stressed out  at the end of the semester because I took ADS1001 lightly. When it was time to submit the project, I realized there were many things I could have done to improve the project and get better marks while learning a lot more.

Before taking the data science unit, I believed ADS1001 was just about learning different Python libraries and using them to visualize data. However, I later realized that data is the core element for any business or field. This became clear when we were given the project at the end. My group and I completed the project, but I learned many things and ways to improve my learning that I plan to implement next semester.

Firstly, I pledged to make notes of pre-readings and solve in-class materials for better practice. This way, when it's time to do a project, I can focus on research questions rather than stressing about the coding part and revisiting entire weeks of material. I also believe that weekly notebooks are essential for mastering different libraries, as they require more critical thinking. Additionally, there was a lack of group communication, so this semester, I will try to take on a leadership role to ensure better communication and project results. 
Finally, I plan to clarify any confusion regarding pre-readings throughout the semester to avoid any misunderstandings.

Reflective Journal - 2

In these early days of the semester, I am really excited about the project. This semester, the project description is straightforward, giving us plenty of time to focus on the finer details. It motivates me to be more attentive in class because I understand that everything taught will help me with the project.

Moreover, the option to add our preferences to the project is a great initiative by the instructor. It allows us to choose topics that interest us. Compared to last semester, I would definitely say that this semester's project is more engaging. It helps me come up with more detailed questions, and the provided data is easier to understand.

During our group meeting, we found the project really interesting and are looking forward to giving our best effort. So far, I haven't faced any challenging tasks in the project, probably because it is still in its initial stages. However, I anticipate that we might encounter difficulties later when we start plotting and analyzing trends.

Reflective Journal - 3

Reflecting on the past five weeks, the syllabus has been fairly basic, with most concepts being easy to grasp. There were a few confusing topics in Week 4, but with the help of the TA, everything was clarified.

Regarding the project, my team is working on a climate-related topic. We hold weekly meetings to discuss our progress, and tasks are divided among group members. The collaboration within the group has been excellent; we communicate via Teams, and everyone responds promptly, which has greatly facilitated our progress.

Our assigned TA has been incredibly supportive, assisting us with any project-related challenges. This guidance has been invaluable, especially when we encountered difficulties with understanding the datasets at the beginning. However, things have since become much clearer, and we’re making steady progress.

Overall, I find the project fascinating, and I'm eager to continue working with my group. Although I initially struggled with how to utilize the data for our modeling, everything is now falling into place.

In conclusion, the past four weeks have been a great experience, and I’m looking forward to the remainder of the course.
